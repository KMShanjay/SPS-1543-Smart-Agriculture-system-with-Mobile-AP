# Smart Agriculture system with Mobile App

Project Description:

   :) Smart Agriculture System based on IoT can monitor soil moisture and climatic conditions to grow and yield a good crop.
   :) The farmer can also get the realtime weather forecasting data by using external platforms like Open Weather API.
   :) Farmer is provided a Mobile app using which he can monitor the temperature,humidity and soil moisture parameters along with weather forecasting details.
   :)  Based on all the parameters he can water his crop by controlling the motors using the Mobile application.
   :) Even if the farmer is not present near his crop he can water his crop by controlling the motors using the Mobile application from anywhere.
   :) Here we are using the Online IoT simulator for getting the Temperature,Humidity and Soil Moisture values.
